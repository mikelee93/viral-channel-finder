Not you again. You not had enough of fish and chips yet? I'm not even going to ask if you're having a good day. >> Guess what I'm back for today? >> Fish and chips. >> Yes, please. Let me guess. Plenty of salt. Plenty of vinegar. >> Yep. You got it. To grab a drink today if that's okay. Is that cherry Coca-Cola down there? >> What does it look like? >> It looks like cherry coca to me. Can I have that, please? Can I get some mushy peas, please? >> Sure. I'll see you again soon. >> Yeah, probably in a few days. See you.
