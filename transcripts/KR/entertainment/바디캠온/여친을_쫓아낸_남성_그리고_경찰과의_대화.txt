[00:00 - 00:02]  What's going on?
[00:02 - 00:03]  I told her to get the f**k out.
[00:03 - 00:03]  Okay.
[00:03 - 00:05]  And so I pushed her the f**k out. She wouldn't f**king leave.
[00:05 - 00:06]  Can you step in here?
[00:06 - 00:07]  No.
[00:07 - 00:09]  Can you step in here away from the rifle so that we can talk?
[00:09 - 00:10]  It's behind me.
[00:10 - 00:12]  Yeah, like three steps behind you.
[00:12 - 00:14]  I'm tired of the bulls**t. I'm tired of everything.
[00:14 - 00:15]  How hard did you push her?
[00:15 - 00:16]  Not very.
[00:16 - 00:17]  Not very?
[00:17 - 00:19] (Audio Gap / Potential Dialogue or SFX)
[00:19 - 00:21]  I'm not going to jail tonight. I hope you know that.
[00:21 - 00:23]  That's why that f**king rifle's there. I'm not going to f**king jail tonight.
[00:23 - 00:25]  I've been in plenty of firefights in my f**king life.
[00:25 - 00:27]  You just said you were going to f**king shoot me.
[00:27 - 00:29]  I didn't say I was going to shoot you. I said I wasn't going to jail.
[00:29 - 00:32]  If I wanted to f**k you guys, it would have already been f**king done.
[00:32 - 00:34]  Can you step inside?
[00:34 - 00:35]  I'm right here.
[00:35 - 00:36]  You're not in any danger right now.
[00:36 - 00:39]  If I walk backwards and grab that motherf**ker,
[00:39 - 00:40]  you see? You see?
[00:40 - 00:41]  Look at that. You're f**ked.
[00:41 - 00:43]  Listen here. I did two f**king deployments.
[00:43 - 00:45]  We're perfectly fine having a civil conversation.
[00:45 - 00:45]  You're not?
[00:45 - 00:47]  You're going to get it. You're going to get it.
