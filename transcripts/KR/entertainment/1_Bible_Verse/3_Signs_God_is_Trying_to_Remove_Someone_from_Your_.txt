Some people are in your life for a reason and others only for a season. But how do you know when God is telling you to let someone go? Today, let's talk about three clear signs that God might be removing someone from your life. Even though it's hard, sometimes it's God's way of protecting you and leading you to something better. The Bible shows us many stories like this. One of them is about Abraham and his nephew Lot. They traveled together and God blessed them both with many animals and servants. But soon there were arguments between their workers. Abraham didn't want fighting. He trusted God and told Lot. You choose where to go and I will go the other way. Lot chose his land and left. After Lot left, God spoke to Abraham and showed him the land he had promised. This story shows us that sometimes God removes people from our lives so he can bless us in new ways. So, what are the signs God might be removing someone from your life? Sign number one, you lose your peace around them. God often speaks to us through peace or the lack of it. When someone constantly leaves you feeling anxious, drained, or uneasy. That's not just your emotions talking. It might be God showing you that something isn't right. Peace is one of the clearest indicators of God's presence. And when that peace disappears around a certain person, it's a sign you shouldn't ignore. God doesn't want you walking through life burdened by toxic connections. When your spirit is restless around someone, he may be nudging you to step back. Sign number two, they distract you from your purpose or faith. God has a calling on your life, and not everyone can go with you. If someone in your life constantly pulls you away from what God has called you to do or weakens your relationship with him, that's a red flag. You may find yourself skipping time with God, compromising your values, or losing sight of who you are. That's not love. That's not growth. When someone dims your light instead of helping it shine brighter, God may be telling you it's time to let go. Sign number three, life keeps separating you from them. Sometimes God closes doors that we are too afraid to close ourselves. No matter how many times you try to reconnect, something keeps getting in the way. misunderstandings, distance, changes in season. It's like life itself is pulling you apart. That's not just coincidence. It could be divine protection. God may be gently removing someone to make room for something greater. Even if it hurts now, trust that he sees the bigger picture. He knows what and who is best for your journey. Let's pray together. Heavenly Father, thank you for loving us enough to remove what's not meant for us. Give us the courage to release the people you're asking us to let go of. Help us trust your plans even when it's painful. Fill our hearts with peace and clarity and surround us with people who bring us closer to you. In Jesus' name, amen.
