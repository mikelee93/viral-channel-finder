why is it that those who are called to a higher purpose often face the deepest battles with lust it's a struggle that no one likes to talk about yet it's more common than you think and the reasons behind it are shocking if you're feeling overwhelmed by this silent battle you're not alone in fact there's a Biblical explanation for it let's uncover the truth behind this hidden struggle throughout the Bible some of the most anointed people faced Fierce Temptations think of King David a man after God's Own Heart who fell into the Trap of lust with baath Sheba or Samson whose strength and calling were overshadowed by his weakness for Delilah even today those chosen by God are not exempt from this struggle but why why does lust seem to Target those set apart for greatness it's not just about human weakness it's a spiritual battle and the enemy knows exactly who to Target the Bible makes it clear that spiritual warfare is real Ephesians 612 says for we do not wrestle against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers against the rulers of the darkness of this age against spiritual hosts of wickedness in the Heavenly places lust isn't just a physical Temptation it's a spiritual attack aimed at those with a Divine calling the enemy knows that if he can corrupt the purity of a chosen one he can hinder God's purpose for their life but why does this struggle hit so hard here are five shocking reasons one spiritual sensitivity makes Temptation stronger being spiritually gifted often means having heightened awareness not just of God's presence but also of the enemy's tactics lust is a powerful tool the enemy uses to distract and weaken those with Divine callings chosen ones often experience more intense Temptations because the enemy knows that if he can trap them in lust he can slow down or even derail their spirit ual growth two isolation leads to Hidden battles chosen ones are often set apart walking a path that few can understand while this Solitude can be a blessing it also creates a dangerous vulnerability without strong accountability or deep spiritual connections lust becomes a private struggle the secrecy of this battle makes it harder to overcome leading many chosen ones to suffer in silence three High Calling attracts greater attacks the higher the calling the stronger the Warfare lust isn't just a natural human struggle it is a spiritual attack designed to keep chosen ones distracted drained and distanced from God many great leaders prophets and spiritual Warriors have fallen because they underestimated the power of this battle the enemy uses lust as a constant snare knowing that even the strongest Warriors can be brought down by their flesh four emotional wounds create open doors many chosen ones carry deep emotional wounds rejection abandonment past heartbreaks these unhealed scars can become open doors for lust when a person is emotionally vulnerable the enemy offers lust as a false Comfort a counterfeit connection to fill the void without inner healing lust becomes a coping mechanism creating a cycle of sin and shame that is is hard to break five strong spiritual gifts come with a weak flesh many chosen ones have powerful spiritual gifts but they are still human the flesh remains weak and without consistent spiritual discipline prayer fasting and renewing the mind the battle against lust intensifies the greater the anointing the greater the need for self-control without actively strengthening their Spirit chosen ones can easily find themselves falling into patterns of lustful thoughts and actions lust is a battle that many chosen ones face in secret but Victory is possible through spiritual discipline accountability and healing they can overcome this struggle and continue walking in their Divine Purpose the enemy's goal is to keep them trapped but God's power is always greater the question is will they fight or will they fall [Music] [Music]
