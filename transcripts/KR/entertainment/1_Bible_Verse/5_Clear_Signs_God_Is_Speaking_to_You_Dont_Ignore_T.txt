Have you ever felt like God is trying to tell you something, but you're not sure if it's really him? Maybe you've been praying for answers, looking for direction, or hoping for confirmation about something in your life. But how do you know if it's God speaking or just your own thoughts? Today, we're going to explore five clear signs that God is speaking to you, and by the end of this video, you'll have a better understanding of how to recognize his voice. Think about Samuel in the Bible. One night as a young boy, he kept hearing someone call his name. He thought it was Eli the priest, but Eli told him, "I didn't call you." This happened three times until Eli realized it was God speaking to Samuel. He told him, "When you hear it again, say, "Speak, Lord, for your servant is listening." 1st Samuel 3:9. The same thing happens in our lives. God speaks, but sometimes we don't recognize his voice. So, how do we know it's really God? Here are five signs to look for. The first sign that God is speaking to you is through scripture. The Bible isn't just a book. It's God's living word. Have you ever read a verse and felt like it was written just for you at that moment? That's no coincidence. Hebrews 4:12 tells us, "For the word of God is alive and powerful. It is sharper than the sharpest two-edged sword, cutting between soul and spirit, between joint and marrow. It exposes our innermost thoughts and desires. When a verse grabs your heart or brings conviction, that's God speaking directly to your soul. The second sign is a deep sense of peace even in chaos. Jesus said in John 14 27, I am leaving you with a gift, peace of mind and heart. And the peace I give is a gift the world cannot give. When you're facing storms in your life, but still feel an unexplainable calm, that's God reassuring you that he's in control. This peace doesn't make sense to the world, but it's a powerful sign that God is speaking to your spirit. The third sign is repeated messages. Sometimes God speaks through repetition. You might hear the same message in a sermon, see it in your Bible reading, and even hear it from a friend, all in the same week. When that happens, pay attention. God knows we're sometimes slow to catch on, so he repeats himself to make sure we get it. The fourth sign is a conviction in your heart. This isn't the same as guilt or shame. It's a gentle, loving nudge toward what's right. The Holy Spirit works in us to guide our choices and correct our paths. John 16:13 reminds us, "When the spirit of truth comes, he will guide you into all truth." If you feel compelled to do something good or turn away from a harmful habit, that's God steering your heart. Finally, the fifth sign is confirmation through others. God often uses people to speak into our lives. Maybe someone gives you wise counsel that lines up with God's word, or you hear a testimony that directly addresses your situation. Proverbs 11:14 says, "Without wise leadership, a nation falls. There is safety in having many advisers." God places the right people around you to confirm his guidance. Now that you know these signs, take a moment to reflect. Have you experienced any of them recently? Maybe God's been speaking, but you just didn't recognize it. Start tuning your heart to his voice by spending time in prayer and scripture. Be open to his guidance and ready to move when he calls.
