you think you're in control you tell yourself it's just a little Temptation I can stop anytime but deep down you know the truth you've tried to walk away but something keeps pulling you back the thoughts the desires they don't just visit you they dominate you and no matter how hard you fight you feel chained is it just your flesh or is it something more lust isn't just a feeling it's a doorway a trap that many don't even realize they've stepped into and the Bible warns us that some struggles aren't just human weakness some battles Are Spiritual Ephesians 6:12 reminds us for we are not fighting against flesh and blood enemies but against evil rulers and authorities of the Unseen World against Mighty powers in this dark world and against evil spirits in the Heavenly places if lust is something you've battled for years if it feels more like an addiction than a Temptation then you might be dealing with more than just bad habits you might be dealing with a demon of lust here are five signs that this Spirit may be influencing your life number one uncontrollable thoughts and urges no matter how much you pray or try to resist the thoughts keep coming they show up in your mind at random times even when you're not trying to think about them you could be at church reading the Bible or spending time with family and suddenly an inappropriate thought in invades your mind this isn't normal Temptation This is torment when lust takes over your mind like this it's a sign that the enemy is at work James 4:7 says so humble yourselves before God resist the devil and he will flee from you but if the thoughts aren't fleeing it's time to ask why number two addiction to lustful content whether it's pornography seductive social media posts or even inappropriate books and movies you feel drawn to it you tell yourself it's the last time but you always go back it's like a cycle guilt shame repentance and then you do it again Jesus was clear in Matthew 5:28 but I say anyone who even looks at a woman with lust has already committed adultery with her in his heart if you feel enslaved to lustful content this isn't just a bad habit it's bondage number three nightly spiritual attacks and disturbing dreams do you have dreams of intimacy with unknown figures do you feel strange Sensations in your sleep like something is touching you many don't realize this but demonic spirits can influence dreams and even create spiritual covenants through them if you often wake up feeling drained guilty or violated it's time to pray second Timothy 1 1:7 reminds us for God has not given us a spirit of fear and timidity but of power love and self-discipline if your dreams are being invaded it's time to fight back in the spirit number four inability to build Godly relationships lust pushes you away from real love it makes you see people as objects instead of souls if you find yourself struggling to connect emotionally in relationships constantly falling into situationships or unable to stay pure in courtship the spirit of lust might be behind it the enemy knows that Godly relationships lead to powerful marriages so he works to corrupt your view of love before you even get there 1 Corinthians 6: 18 says run from sexual sin no other sin so clearly affects the body as this one does for sexual immorality is a sin against your own body number five feeling distant from God sin creates distance between us and God but when it's a demonic stronghold the distance feels unbearable you might find it hard to pray hard to worship hard to even read the Bible without feeling unworthy that's the enemy's goal to make you feel trapped so you won't seek God for Freedom Romans 8:1 reminds us so now there is no condemnation for those who belong to Christ Jesus if lust has made you feel like like you can't approach God don't believe the lie Jesus came to set the captives free if any of these signs sound familiar It's Time To Break Free the first step is confession 1 John 1:9 says but if we confess our sins to him he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all wickedness the second step is Deliverance Prayer fasting and surrounding yourself with God's truth lust loses its power when it's exposed to the light so don't stay in bondage seek God resist the devil and walk in Freedom if this message spoke to you let me know in the comments and if you're ready for more life-changing biblical truth subscribe and turn on notifications God has a plan for your Purity and your purpose don't let the enemy steal it n
