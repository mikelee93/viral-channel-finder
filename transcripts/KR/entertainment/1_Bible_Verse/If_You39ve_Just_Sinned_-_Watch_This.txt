You didn't plan to do it, but you did. The guilt hit you like a wave the moment it happened. And now you're wondering if God still wants you, still loves you, still hears you. You feel unworthy to even pray, like you blew your chance again. If that's you right now, this message is for you. Don't click away because God is not done with you yet. We've all been there. Moments where we fall short again. We mess up, say things we didn't mean, go places we shouldn't, think things we regret. It's that sinking feeling afterward that convinces us we've failed too many times, that maybe this time God is disappointed for good. But the Bible shows us something radically different. God's love doesn't operate like ours. His mercy doesn't have a limit. And if you've just sinned and your heart is heavy, what you're about to hear could change everything. Let's go back to a story so raw it's almost uncomfortable to read. In John chapter 8, a woman was caught in the act of adultery. Not rumors, not gossip. She was caught dragged into the streets, thrown in front of Jesus, surrounded by religious leaders holding stones, ready to punish her. She didn't get to clean herself up. She didn't get time to explain. She was fully exposed, ashamed, embarrassed, terrified. But instead of condemning her, Jesus said something that shocked everyone. He told the crowd, "Let the one who has never sinned throw the first stone." One by one, they walked away. Then Jesus turned to her and said, "Neither do I condemn you. Go and sin no more." That's in John 8 7 and 11. What does that tell us? It tells us that even when we're caught in the middle of our worst sin, when we're ashamed, exposed, and expecting punishment, Jesus doesn't turn away from us, he speaks mercy. He offers grace. He lifts us up not to ignore our sin, but to free us from it. That's the heart of God. Ephesians 1:7 reminds us, "He is so rich in kindness and grace that he purchased our freedom with the blood of his son and forgave our sins." Did you catch that? Forgiveness is already paid for. You don't have to beg God to love you again. He never stopped. You don't have to earn his mercy. It's already yours. What he wants is your heart, not your perfection, just your surrender. Here's the truth most people miss. When you sin, the enemy wants you to hide from God. But God wants you to run toward him. Think of a little child who scrapes their knee. They don't hide from their parent. They cry and run into their arms. That's what your father in heaven wants. Not distance, not silence, just honesty, just you. Psalm 51:17 says, "The sacrifice you desire is a broken spirit. You will not reject a broken and repentant heart, oh God." If your heart is heavy today, if you feel broken by what you've done, then you're exactly where healing begins. That's the kind of heart God welcomes with open arms. So, what do you do now? First, talk to God. You don't need fancy words. Just be real. Tell him what happened. Tell him how you feel. Ask for forgiveness. Then believe that he hears you, forgives you, and still calls you his own. Second, forgive yourself. That's often the hardest part. We hold on to shame long after God has let it go. But Romans 8:1 says, "So now there is no condemnation for those who belong to Christ Jesus." None. That includes you. You may still feel the weight, but God's already removed the guilt. Don't carry what Jesus already died to take off your shoulders. Third, get back up. Sin doesn't have to be the end of your story. In fact, it can be the beginning of a deeper relationship with God. Let this moment soften your heart, not harden it. Let it teach you to rely on God's strength, not your own. Let it remind you that your walk with him was never about being flawless. It's about being faithful. Keep walking. Keep trusting. Keep growing. [Music] [Music]
