Some seasons make you feel as if everything is slipping away from you. Moments when losses pile up so fast that you begin to wonder if restoration is even possible. But what if I told you that the season you are in right now may be the final stretch before God restores everything you lost? What if the pressure you feel is not the ending, but the sign that you are closer than you think? Think about Job for a moment. He did not know that his darkest hour was actually the doorway to his greatest restoration. He could not see the conversations in heaven. He could not see that God had already placed a limit on his suffering. Job simply held on. He stayed faithful when nothing made sense. Sometimes the greatest sign that restoration is near is when everything around you tries to convince you that it is not. That is often how God works. He restores right after the season that tried to break you. The Bible gives us clear insight. Joel 2:25 says that God will restore the years that the locusts have eaten. Psalm 34:18 says that the Lord is close to the brokenhearted. Isaiah 61:7 declares that instead of shame, you will receive a double portion. These verses show us that restoration is not just a possibility, it is a promise. God always finishes what he starts. God always rebuilds what life tried to damage. And God always lifts his people right after the moment when they feel most forgotten. One sign that God is about to restore what you lost is spiritual restlessness. You can feel that where you are now is not where you will stay. You may feel tired, but something inside you refuses to give up. You may feel empty, yet at the same time, you feel a spark of hope that you did not create. That is God preparing your spirit for what he is about to do. Another sign is unexpected pruning. People leave your life. Plans fall apart. Opportunities close. At first it feels like punishment, but later you realize that God removed what would have blocked your blessing. Just like Joseph, [music] you may not understand the betrayal, the rejection, or the disappointment, but it is shaping you for a greater assignment. Genesis 50:20 reminds us that what was meant for evil, God will turn for good. Another sign is renewed hunger for God. When restoration is near, the Holy Spirit begins to pull you back into prayer. You start desiring the word [music] again. You feel a fresh call to seek God in a deeper way. This is not random. God increases your hunger because he is preparing you to carry the next level. God restores what you lost, but he also prepares you to keep it. Another sign is divine reminders. You keep hearing messages about restoration. You keep coming across scriptures about breakthrough. You feel God speaking to you through sermons, music, [music] and conversations. It is his gentle way of saying, "Stay ready. I am working. You are closer than you think." In real life, this means you must keep your faith active. [music] You must keep your heart open even when you feel dry. Restoration often shows up in ways you do not expect. God may bring new connections. He may open doors that you did not pray for. He may replace what you lost with something better than you imagined. [music] But you must stay sensitive and expectant. If you lost relationships, God can restore peace, healing, or new people who value you. If you lost opportunities, God can create doors that no human can close. If you lost time, God can accelerate your life in ways that make up for everything you thought was wasted. God is not limited by years, by people, or by circumstances. [music] When God decides that your restoration has come, nothing can stop it. The key is to trust him even when the process feels slow. Keep doing what Job did. Keep holding on. Keep honoring God in the middle of your questions. Keep showing up with faith. What you lost was painful, but what God is preparing will carry greater glory. Romans 8:18 says that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory that will be revealed. Your restoration will not just return what you lost. It will return it with increase. It will return it with purpose. It will return it with a testimony that [music] strengthens others. Let us pray. Heavenly Father, we come before you with open hearts. Restore the years the enemy tried to steal. Restore peace, strength, and joy. Restore everything that was lost through pain, delay, or attack. Prepare us for the new things you are releasing. Give us faith to hold on. Give us strength to trust your timing. We believe that restoration is near. We believe that you are working even when we do not see it. In Jesus' name, amen.
