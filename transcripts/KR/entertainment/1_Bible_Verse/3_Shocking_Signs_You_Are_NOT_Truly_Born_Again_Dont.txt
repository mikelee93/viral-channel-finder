Many people today assume they are Christians just because they attend church, say prayers, or even know Bible stories. But Jesus gave us a very serious warning. In Matthew 7:21, he said, "Not everyone who calls out to me,"Lord, Lord, will enter the kingdom of heaven. Only those who actually do the will of my father in heaven will enter." That means it's possible to look religious on the outside, but not be truly born again on the inside. Think for a moment about Judas's Scariot. He walked with Jesus for 3 years. He heard every sermon. He saw every miracle. He looked like a follower on the outside. But in the end, he betrayed the son of God. Judas is the perfect example that being around the things of God does not guarantee you are truly saved. Being born again is more than just saying a prayer or attending church. It's about a transformed heart that shows real evidence of God's spirit inside. Here are three shocking signs you are not truly born again. Number one, no real change in lifestyle. When someone claims to know Jesus but continues to live the same old life with no change, something is wrong. A real encounter with Christ always leaves evidence. You may not become perfect overnight, but your direction changes. Sin begins to feel heavy instead of comfortable. The Bible confirms this in 2 Corinthians 5:17. This means that anyone who belongs to Christ has become a new person. The old life is gone. A new life has begun. If there's no difference between the old life and the new, then it's a sign the heart has not been truly transformed. Number two, no hunger for God's word. Just like a baby naturally craves milk, a person who is truly born again develops a longing for God. They want to read the Bible, spend time in prayer, and know him more deeply. If there's no desire for scripture, no passion for prayer, and no interest in God's presence, then it raises a serious question. 1 Peter 2:2 says, "Like newborn babies, you must crave pure spiritual milk so that you will grow into a full experience of salvation." A Christian without hunger for the word is like a person refusing to eat. It's a sign of spiritual death, not life. Number three, no evidence of the Holy Spirit. The spirit of God is what makes a person truly belong to Christ. You can't fake his presence for long. His work shows up in the fruit he produces. Love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control. If these qualities are completely absent, then there's a red flag. Romans 8:9 warns, "Those who do not have the spirit of Christ living in them do not belong to him at all. Without the spirit, there is no true salvation." Now ask yourself honestly, has my life really changed since I believed in Jesus? Do I have a hunger for his word or do I avoid it? Do I see the fruit of the spirit growing in me or do I live the same as before? These are not easy questions, but they are necessary. Because the good news is this. If you realize today that you are not truly born again, God is giving you an opportunity right now to repent, surrender, and start new. John 3:3 reminds us, I tell you the truth, unless you are born again, you cannot see the kingdom of God. Eternity is too important to ignore. Don't just settle for religion.
