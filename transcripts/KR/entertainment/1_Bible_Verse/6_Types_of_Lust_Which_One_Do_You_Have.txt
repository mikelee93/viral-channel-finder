lust isn't just about physical desire it creeps into different areas of life distorting our hearts and pulling us away from God's purpose most people think of lust as just a sexual temptation but the Bible reveals that lust takes many forms some we don't even realize could you be struggling with a type of lust without even knowing it in the Garden of Eden Eve saw the forbidden fruit and wanted the wisdom it would give her Genesis 3:6 her desire wasn't just about hunger it was about wanting something outside of God's will that's what lust does it blinds us with Cravings making us chase things that can never truly satisfy let's look at six types of lust that can take control of our hearts first the Lust For Pleasure this goes beyond normal enjoyment it's an obsession with feeling good at any cost people chase thrill after thrill from excessive partying to dangerous addictions thinking happiness is found in pleasure but Proverbs 21:17 warns those who love pleasure become poor those who love wine and luxury will never be rich pleasure itself isn't evil but when it rules us we lose control second the lust for power some crave control over others manipulating situations to stay on top this lust isn't always obvious it hides behind ambition competitiveness or even the need to to always be right but Jesus taught a different way in Mark 10: 43-44 he said whoever wants to be a leader among you must be your servant true greatness isn't about power it's about humility third the Lust For wealth money itself isn't evil but an obsession with riches leads to destruction many people sacrifice their integrity family and Faith just to gain more 1 Timothy ch 6:9 warns but people who long to be rich fall into temptation and are trapped by many foolish and harmful desires that plunge them into ruin and destruction greed tricks us into thinking that more money will bring security but only God can provide true peace fourth the Lust For recognition this is the craving for attention praise and approval social media makes this worse people measure their worth by likes comments and followers but in John 12:43 Jesus exposed this struggle for they loved human praise more than the praise of God when we seek recognition over righteousness we lose sight of what truly matters fifth the lust for knowledge this one is tricky wanting to learn isn't wrong but some Chase knowledge just to feel Superior they seek answers apart from God relying on human wisdom alone in 1 Corinthians 8:1 Paul warns knowledge puffs up but love builds up true wisdom isn't about knowing more it's about knowing god finally the lust for physical desires this is the one most people think of sexual Temptation the Bible warns against letting lust take control saying in 1 Thessalonians 4: 3-5 God's will is for you to be holy so stay away from all sexual sin lust ful thoughts pornography and impure relationships damage our spirits and distance us from God's best for our lives lust is sneaky it can take hold in ways we don't expect but the good news is God provides a way out James 4:7 says so humble yourselves before God resist the devil and he will flee from you the first step to Freedom is recognizing the problem and then surrendering it to Jesus if this message spoke to you take a moment to reflect ask God to reveal any hidden desires that are pulling you away from him and if you want to keep growing in faith subscribe to one Bible verse for more biblical wisdom let's walk this journey together see you in the next video h
