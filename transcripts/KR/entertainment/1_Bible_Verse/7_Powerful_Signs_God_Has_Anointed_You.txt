Some things don't just happen. They're signs. You keep going through things that don't make sense to others. You feel things that are hard to explain. You carry a weight in your spirit that seems invisible to the people around you. It's not all in your head. These moments may be the proof you've been looking for, that you're anointed by God. Let's talk about it. Think about David. He was just a shepherd boy out in the fields, completely overlooked by everyone, even his own family. But God saw him. God chose him. He was anointed in private before he was ever recognized in public. That's how God works. He doesn't choose the loudest, the strongest, or the most popular. He chooses the willing, the humble, the ones who have been prepared in silence. And maybe that's you. Isaiah 61:1 says, "The spirit of the sovereign Lord is upon me, for the Lord has anointed me to bring good news to the poor. He has sent me to comfort the brokenhearted and to proclaim that captives will be released and prisoners will be freed." The anointing isn't just a title, it's a calling. And if these seven things keep happening in your life, it may be the confirmation you've been waiting for. Number one, you face intense spiritual warfare. There are times when it feels like you're under attack for no reason. You pray harder. And somehow the pressure increases. That's because the enemy doesn't fight what doesn't threaten him. You're not being punished. You're being targeted because you're marked by God. Number two, you're drawn to God. Even in your darkest moments, you've tried walking away. You've had seasons where you wanted to give up, but something always pulls you back. That's not guilt or emotion. That's divine connection. When you're anointed, you can't stay disconnected for long. His spirit keeps calling you. Number three, you feel burdened by things others ignore. While others scroll past injustice or laugh off sin, something in you can't. You cry for people you've never met. You feel a deep sadness when you see brokenness. That's not oversensitivity. That's spiritual sensitivity. God has placed a piece of his heart in yours. Number four, you're called to hard things. Nothing about your life has been easy. You've had to fight for peace, for clarity, for healing. But look closely. Those battles have shaped your faith. God uses pressure to produce oil. And the anointing is often found on the other side of pain. Number five, you attract jealousy or opposition. Sometimes people misunderstand you. You felt left out, attacked, or judged without reason. That's because your presence disturbs comfort zones. Just like Joseph was hated for his dreams, your spiritual identity makes others uncomfortable. Don't shrink back. Number six, your words carry weight. You're not the loudest person in the room, but when you speak, people listen. Not because of charisma, but because of conviction. The Holy Spirit backs your words. That's the difference between noise and anointing. It's not about being popular, it's about being prophetic. Number seven, you see and hear spiritually. You've had dreams that came true. You feel things you can't always explain. You pick up on atmospheres and sense when something isn't right. This isn't imagination. It's discernment. God reveals things to those he trusts. And if that's you, take it seriously. Now, take a deep breath. Let this sink in. You're not crazy. You're not too emotional. You're not overthinking. If these seven things keep showing up in your life, you might be walking in something sacred. And it's time to own it. The anointing doesn't make you better than others. It calls you to serve others. It doesn't give you a platform. It gives you a burden. You were chosen for something greater than comfort. And though the road isn't always easy, you were never meant to walk it alone. So the next time you're in a battle, the next time you feel unseen, the next time you question if you're even called, remember this. Oil flows from crushed olives. Purpose is birthed through pain, and your anointing will always attract opposition, but it also carries heaven's approval. Let's pray together. God, thank you for choosing us even when we don't feel worthy. Help us recognize the signs of your anointing. Give us the strength to carry what you've placed on our lives and teach us to walk boldly, humbly, and faithfully in Jesus' name. Amen. If this spoke to your heart, don't keep it to yourself.
