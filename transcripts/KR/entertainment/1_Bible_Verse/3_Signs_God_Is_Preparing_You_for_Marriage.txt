Before God joins two people together, he works on them individually. Just like a gardener doesn't plant until the soil is ready, God doesn't send the right person until your heart is ready. The waiting season isn't wasted. It's where God refineses your character, deepens your faith, and prepares you to love like Christ. So, let's talk about three clear signs that God is preparing you for marriage. Number one, you're being healed from past hurts. Before you can love someone deeply, God will often bring you through a season of healing. This could mean forgiving someone who hurt you, letting go of bitterness, or even forgiving yourself. It's not always easy because healing means reopening old wounds so God can clean them properly. But this process is necessary for love to grow in purity. Psalm 34:18 says, "The Lord is close to the brokenhearted. He rescues those whose spirits are crushed." God cannot pour new wine into an old wine skin. And that means he won't bring a new relationship while your heart is still holding on to pain from the old one. When God prepares you for marriage, he heals your emotional wounds so that you can love freely without fear or comparison. If you find yourself in a season of deep reflection, forgiveness, or even solitude, don't be discouraged. That's often the first sign that God is doing a beautiful inner work in you. Number two, you're learning to depend on God, not people. One of the biggest mistakes people make is looking for someone to complete them instead of compliment them. God's plan for marriage is not two broken halves becoming whole, but two whole people joining to fulfill his purpose together. Philippians 4:1 19 says, "And this same God who takes care of me will supply all your needs from his glorious riches which have been given to us in Christ Jesus." When you start realizing that your peace, joy, and security come from God and not from anyone else, that's a powerful sign that he's preparing you for marriage. Because the truth is, if you rely on another person to make you happy, you'll always be disappointed. But when your heart is rooted in God, you bring stability into your future relationship instead of insecurity. In this season, God teaches you to be fulfilled in him alone. He becomes your source so that when he finally sends your spouse, they add to your joy, not define it. Number three, God is building your character. Marriage isn't sustained by feelings, it's sustained by character. Before God gives you the blessing of a lifelong partner, he refineses your patience, humility, and ability to love unconditionally. 1 Corinthians 13:4 says, "Love is patient and kind. Love is not jealous or boastful or proud. God will often use everyday challenges to shape you into someone who can love like that. Maybe you're learning to control your temper, to stay calm when things don't go your way, or to trust even when you don't understand. All these moments are spiritual workouts preparing you for the responsibility of marriage. God is not just writing a love story. He's writing a purpose story. He wants you to be ready to serve, forgive, and grow with your future spouse. If you notice that God has been convicting you about your habits, your words, or your reactions, don't ignore it. That's his way of molding your character for something greater. Remember, preparation takes time. You don't rush something you want to last forever. When God is preparing you for marriage, he's not just preparing you for a wedding day, but for a lifetime of covenant. He teaches you how to love sacrificially, how to forgive quickly, and how to stand together in faith when life gets hard. The waiting season may feel lonely, but it's sacred. It's where God is shaping your heart to reflect his love. So instead of asking, "When will it happen?" Start asking, "Lord, what are you teaching me in this season?" Let's pray. Heavenly Father, thank you for being so patient with us as you prepare our hearts for your blessings. Lord, we surrender our desires, our timelines, and our plans to you. Heal the wounds that keep us from loving fully. Teach us to depend on you, to grow in character, and to trust your perfect timing. When the right person comes, may our hearts be ready to love them like you love us. In Jesus' name, amen.
