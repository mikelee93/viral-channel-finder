The devil doesn't always try to destroy your life. Sometimes he just wants to keep you distracted. If he can pull your focus away from God, even a little, that's enough. He doesn't need to attack you with fear or pain. He just needs your attention to be somewhere else, on your phone, your problems, or your busy schedule. And it works. You sit down to pray, but your phone buzzes. You want to read your Bible, but you remember something else you need to do. The day goes by and you realize you haven't talked to God at all. That's not just life being busy. That's the enemy using distraction. Distraction doesn't always look bad. It can look like work, helping people, scrolling through social media, or doing things that feel important. But when those things take the place of time with God, they become a problem. That's how the enemy tricks us, by filling our lives with noise. There's a story in Luke chapter 10 about two sisters, Mary and Martha. Jesus came to visit them. Mary sat at Jesus's feet and listened to him. Martha was busy serving and getting things ready. She got upset that Mary wasn't helping. But Jesus told her, "Martha, Martha, you are worried about many things, but only one thing really matters. Mary has chosen the better thing. Martha wasn't doing anything wrong. She was working hard, but she was too busy to see that the most important thing was just being with Jesus. That's what distraction does. It keeps you from what matters most. Ephesians 5 15-16 says, "So be careful how you live. Don't live like fools, but like those who are wise. make the most of every opportunity in these evil days. That means we have to be smart about how we spend our time. We only get so many chances to grow closer to God. Let's not waste them. Romans 12:2 also tells us, "Don't copy the way this world lives. Let God change the way you think. Then you'll know what God wants for your life." When you spend time with God, he helps you see clearly. You start to notice the distractions and choose better. Sometimes the devil doesn't tempt you with sin. He tempts you with something good that takes you away from what's best. He doesn't mind if you're busy doing nice things as long as you forget to spend time with God. Today, there are distractions everywhere. Your phone, the internet, the news, work, and stress. It's easy to lose focus, but God wants something better for you. Psalm 46:10 says, "Be still and know that I am God." Being still may feel hard, but that's where we hear God's voice. We need to make time for God on purpose. Not because he needs it, but because we do. When we pray, we grow stronger. When we read his word, we become wiser. When we worship, we remember that God is bigger than our problems. These things help us stay close to him. So, how do we stay focused on God in a busy world? Start small. Set a time each day to talk to God. Even 10 minutes can make a big difference. Turn off your phone during that time. Write down anything that distracts you so you can come back to it later. Ask the Holy Spirit to help you focus. And when you feel overwhelmed, just pause, take a deep breath, say Jesus' name. That simple moment can help you find peace and bring your mind back to him. The enemy wants to fill your life with noise, but God speaks in the quiet. Don't let the devil distract you from your purpose. Don't let small things take you away from a big God. You were made to know him deeply. Don't trade that for anything. If this spoke to your heart today, take a moment to ask yourself, what's been stealing your time with God? It might be small things, but they can have a big effect. Don't let the enemy win by keeping you too busy for the one who loves you most.
