Sometimes getting closer to God doesn't feel how you expected. You'd think everything would be peaceful and happy, but instead things start to feel strange. You stop enjoying things you used to like. Some people stop talking to you. You begin to feel different. And that's because you are different. God is working in your heart. You're growing. And that's a beautiful thing. Let's look at the story of Saul who later became Paul. He used to hurt Christians. But then he met Jesus on the road to Damascus and everything changed. He went from hurting people to sharing God's love. But that didn't mean life got easier. He lost friends. People didn't trust him. He went through many hard times. Still, he was closer to God than ever before. That's what happens when your heart is getting closer to him. So, what are the real signs that you're getting closer to God? Not the ones people can see, but the ones deep inside your heart. Sign number one, you feel a holy discomfort. Things you used to enjoy now feel wrong. You can't listen to certain music or watch some shows anymore. Some conversations feel off. You don't feel good doing the things you used to do. That's not just guilt. That's God helping you grow. John 16:8 says, "And when he comes, he will convict the world of its sin and of God's righteousness and of the coming judgment." That feeling in your heart is the Holy Spirit gently showing you what's right. God is changing you to look more like him. Sign number two, you want to spend more time with God. Instead of looking at your phone in the morning, you want to pray. Instead of turning to people or social media when you're sad, you want to open your Bible. You want to feel close to God. And you're not doing it to impress anyone. You just want him. Psalm 42:1 says, "As the deer longs for streams of water, so I long for you, oh God." This kind of hunger means your heart is growing closer to God. And when you feel his presence, nothing else can compare. Sign number three, you love people in a new way. You forgive faster. You're more patient. You try to understand others, even people who hurt you. You don't see people as problems anymore. You see them as souls who need love. That's not weakness. That's strength. That's the love of God growing in your heart. 1 John 4:7 says, "Dear friends, let us continue to love one another. For love comes from God. Anyone who loves is a child of God and knows God. The closer you get to God, the more you begin to love like he does. Maybe you're wondering if God sees the small things you do. The prayers, the changes, the quiet moments, he sees it all. Even when no one else notices, God does. You're not failing. You're growing. God isn't looking for perfection. He's looking for your heart. Philippians 1:6 says, "And I am certain that God, who began the good work within you, will continue his work until it is finally finished. He's not done with you. He's still working." Spiritual growth isn't always big and loud. Sometimes it's slow and quiet, but that doesn't mean it's not real. God is doing something inside of you. So, don't give up. Keep reading your Bible. Keep talking to him. Keep trusting even when it's hard. James 4:8 says, "Come close to God and God will come close to you." That's a promise you can count on. So if you're feeling uncomfortable in places you used to enjoy. If you're wanting more time with God, if you're loving people better, then guess what? You're getting closer to him.
