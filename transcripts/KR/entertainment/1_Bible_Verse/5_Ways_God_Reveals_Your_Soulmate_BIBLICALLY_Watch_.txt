Many people ask, "How do I know if this person is really from God?" The truth is, God does not leave us in the dark. He guides his children with clarity, with peace, and with his word. Today, I want to share with you five powerful biblical ways God reveals your soulmate. Number one, they love God first. Before you look at how they treat you, look at how they treat God. Matthew 22:37 says, "You must love the Lord your God with all your heart, all your soul, and all your mind." A true soulmate sent by God is someone who has a personal relationship with Jesus Christ. If they don't love God above all else, they cannot love you in the way God designed. The person God has for you will point you closer to him, not away from him. Number two, they bring you peace, not confusion. Colossians 3:15 says, "And let the peace that comes from Christ rule in your hearts." When God is revealing your soulmate, you will not live in constant chaos, fear, or doubt. Yes, relationships take effort, but God's choice will carry peace deep inside your spirit. If someone keeps you unsettled, always guessing, always anxious, that's not from God. But if you sense a divine calmness, that's a sign God's hand is on it. Number three, they align with God's word. God will never contradict his word. 2 Corinthians 6:14 says, "Don't team up with those who are unbelievers." How can righteousness be a partner with wickedness? How can light live with darkness? Your soulmate will not pull you into sin, compromise your faith, or push you to disobey God. Instead, their life will match the truth of scripture. Number four, they share your purpose and calling. Amos 3:3 asks, "Can two people walk together without agreeing on the direction?" Your soulmate is not just someone to love romantically, but someone to walk with spiritually. God unites people so they can serve him together. If your goals, values, and mission in Christ align, that is a powerful confirmation. The right person will not only support your calling, they will run with you in the same direction. Number five, their life bears the fruit of the spirit. Jesus gave us a clear standard in Matthew 7:16. You can identify them by their fruit. That is by the way they act. Look at their fruit. Do they show love, patience, kindness, self-control, and faithfulness? A soulmate sent by God will reflect the spirit of God. Their love will not just be emotional. It will be sacrificial, pure, and enduring. Let me ask you, are you looking for your soulmate through your own feelings or through God's biblical standards?
