Some Bible verses don't just comfort. They terrify demons. Not every Christian knows them. But the ones who do walk in authority, peace, and victory. If the enemy has been messing with your mind, your peace, or your family, these five verses hit like fire. They're not just words. They're spiritual weapons. And once you learn how to use them, the enemy doesn't stand a chance. Let's start with the first one. Luke 10:1 19. Look, I have given you authority over all the power of the enemy and you can walk among snakes and scorpions and crush them. Nothing will injure you. This is not a metaphor. Jesus was telling his disciples and every believer that they've been given real authority over every demonic force. When you feel surrounded, attacked, or spiritually weak, speak this verse out loud. It reminds the enemy that you know who you are in Christ, and it reminds you that you are not powerless. The second verse is James 4:7. So humble yourselves before God. Resist the devil and he will flee from you. There's a secret in this verse that many overlook. The power is in submission. When you place your life under God's authority, the enemy has no legal ground to stay. You don't have to scream. You don't have to perform rituals. Just resist. Stand firm in God's truth and he will flee. That's a promise. The third verse is Philippians 2 10- 11. That at the name of Jesus, every knee should bow in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and every tongue declare that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father. Demons don't fear your name. They don't fear your church membership. But they do tremble at the name of Jesus. When you're under attack, declare his name. Speak it boldly. The name of Jesus is above every name, every fear, every addiction, every demonic influence. And when that name is lifted up, darkness has to bow. The fourth verse is Isaiah 54:17. But in that coming day, no weapon turned against you will succeed. You will silence every voice raised up to accuse you. Demonic attacks often come in the form of lies. Accusations in your mind telling you you're not enough, that you failed, that God has abandoned you. But this verse is a shield. Speak it when you feel accused. Speak it when fear creeps in. No weapon formed against you, not in the natural or the spiritual, will succeed. And the fifth verse is 2 Timothy 1:7. For God has not given us a spirit of fear and timidity, but of power, love, and self-discipline. Fear is one of the enemy's favorite weapons. If he can make you afraid, he can stop your faith. But this verse reminds us, fear is not from God. When fear rises, declare this truth. You are filled with power, with love, and with a sound mind. You don't have to be afraid of the dark. You don't have to live your life in fear of spiritual attack. You've already been given everything you need. These verses aren't just for memorizing. They're for living, for declaring, for standing on when life feels like a battle. Demons don't fear Christians who go to church on Sunday, but live in defeat Monday through Saturday. They fear believers who know God's word, speak it, and believe it with all their hearts. So, here's what you can do starting today. Pick one of these verses and start declaring it daily. Write it down. Meditate on it. Speak it over your life, your family, your home. Make it part of your spiritual routine. And when the attacks come, and they will come, you'll be ready, not because of your own strength, but because of the power in God's word. Thank you for watching.
